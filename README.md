# AI-Powered Assistance for the Blind

Welcome to the AI-Powered Assistance for the Blind project! This project leverages Vision-Language Models (VLM) to provide an enhanced and interactive assistance tool for visually impaired individuals.


## Introduction

This project aims to provide a robust AI-driven assistance system for the blind, utilizing advanced Vision-Language Models (VLM). The system is designed to interpret visual data and convert it into descriptive text, which can be relayed to the user via audio, offering a seamless and intuitive user experience.

## Features

- **Image Recognition**: Identifies objects, people, and scenes.
- **Text Recognition**: Reads and vocalizes text from images.
- **Real-Time Assistance**: Provides immediate feedback and descriptions of the environment.
- **Voice Commands**: Supports voice-activated commands for hands-free operation.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-navigate interface designed with accessibility in mind.
